<p>The Chairman opened the meeting at 7.34pm.</p>
<h2>Minutes of Previous Meeting</h2>
<p>These were accepted as a true record of the meeting held on 23 June 2017.</p>
<h2>Matters Arising</h2>
<p>Ian Byett noted that, under the new team scoring rule (best 4 from
5, rather than all 5), virtually all the team results had been decided
before the last fixture. However, Pam Rogers stated that team
participation did seem to have been improved, which was the aim of the
rule change. It was agreed that the situation should be monitored.</p>
<h2>Chairman's Report</h2>
<p>We thank Bournemouth AC, City of Portsmouth AC assisted by
Winchester &amp; District AC, Basingstoke &amp; Mid Hants AC assisted
by Overton Harriers, Reading AC and Aldershot, Farnham &amp; District
AC for hosting the fixtures.</p>
<p>The position of Chairman is still vacant.</p>
<h2>Secretary's Report</h2>
<p>Once again it is requested that all clubs supply a new list in
advance of next season's first fixture of their members likely to
compete in each age group, using one of the formats supplied by Pam
Rogers.</p>
<h2>Treasurer's Report</h2>
<p>I would like to thank our host clubs for last season (Aldershot,
Basingstoke, Bournemouth, Reading and Portsmouth/Winchester) for
hosting.</p>
<p>As detailed in the accounts summary we have an income surplus this
year of £639.46, however we did not have any M5 costs as AFD took the
decision to support us by absorbing the costs. Due to a number of
personal events I am late in requesting the sponsorship from Alton
Sports but this is now in hand and will appear in next year's accounts.</p>
<p>As a result of the number of teams fielding less than 13 athletes
over the 5 meetings the committee would like to recommend that the
following clubs pay the lower £50 affiliation fee for the 2018/19
season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dorchester</li>
<li>Guernsey</li>
<li>Wessex Road Runners</li>
<li>Chichester Runners</li>
<li>University of Southampton</li>
<li>Jersey Spartan</li>
<li>Team Spy</li>
<li>Romsey Road Runners</li>
<li>Lymington Athletes</li>
<li>Chapel Tristars</li>
</ul>
<p>The 6 clubs with the largest runner participation will continue to pay £150 league affiliation, and are as last season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aldershot, Farnham &amp; District</li>
<li>Reading AC</li>
<li>Winchester &amp; District</li>
<li>Southampton</li>
<li>Basingstoke &amp; Mid Hants</li>
<li>City of Portsmouth</li>
</ul>
<p>with all other clubs as well as any new clubs this season paying the
middle band fee of £100. This middle band is an increase of £10 (last
increase was 2012/13 season) and is aimed at offsetting the support
through reduced fees for smaller clubs as well as the effects of
increasing First Aid, portaloos.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank our sponsors for this season and next, Alton Sports, and Dave Vosser for auditing the accounts.</p>
<p><i>The increase of the middle band fee from £90 to £100 was approved by 13 votes for, none against and 1 abstention.</i></p>
<h2>New Membership Affiliation/Resignation</h2>
<p>Interest in joining the League has been expressed by Itchen
Spitfires, Hamworthy Harriers, Hart Runners and Blackwater Valley
Runners.</p>

<h2>Dates, Venues and Host Clubs for Season 2018/2019</h2>
<p>The first four fixtures are in hand but Hardley Runners are still in
the process of arranging a course for the final fixture at Dibden
Inclosure and substantial assistance would be necessary from other
clubs with marshalling. The parking issues experienced on the previous
visit to this venue were highlighted.</p>

<h2>Election of Officers</h2>
<p>The Secretary, Treasurer, Men's Results Secretary and Ladies'
Results Secretary were re-elected, en bloc, as proposed by Ian Byett
and seconded by David Vosser. As no candidates had come forward for the
post, the Secretary agreed to continue as Acting Chairman. However, it
is vital for the health of the League that this vacancy should be
filled on a permanent basis.</p>
<h2>Presentation of Senior Awards</h2>
<p>The awards from the last season for Under 20s, Seniors and Veterans
were made, generally to representatives from the recipients' clubs.
However, Ruth Jones was there to receive her award for second Veteran
Woman in person.</p>
<h2>Any Other Business</h2>
<p>There was discussion of equalising the distance of the Senior Men's
and Women's races. The committee will consider canvassing the clubs.</p>
<p>The meeting closed at 8.52pm.</p>
