<h2>Parking</h2>
<p>Although there is ample parking available in the College grounds,
car-pooling is recommended if possible. The four parking locations will
be clearly marked - please follow signage and directions of the
Marshals there to make everyone's life easier. There will be a £2 per
vehicle entry fee to the car parks and the correct change would be
appreciated.</p>
<h2>Pets</h2>
<p><b>Only fully inoculated assistance (Guide) Dogs are allowed in the
grounds of the College and then only after they have been registered
with the College offices with proof of inoculation. No other pets are
allowed in the college grounds.</b></p>
<h2>Start/Finish area and other facilities<br />
</h2>
<p>Will be clearly sign-posted. Maps of the various distance routes
will be on display. Toilets and a College-organised catering van
facility will also be available there. First Aid support will be centrally based in the Start/Finish area.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sparsholt College has advised us that
they will unlikely be able to take debit/credit cards for payment of
refreshments at their own van.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">This is due to the weak phone signal at
their location, that might well also make the use of mobile phones
during the day difficult.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Can everyone coming therefore please
bring cash along for your tea, coffee, water, soft drinks and the fast
food that they will be offering.</p>
<h4>Alternative refreshments</h4>
<p>Available in the Bytes café (open 10:00-18:00) close by the main Car Park.</p>

<p>The courses will be properly roped off. All athletes must stay within
these clearly-identifiable boundaries and everyone must stay off all
football/rugby pitches, whether warming up or actually competing.
Marshals will be strategically located around the various routes and
will have walkie-talkie phones for ease of communication in the event
of any unusual or unexpected incident or activity.</p>

<h4>Routes</h4>
<p>The Under 11 and Under 13 routes stay within the boundaries of the
sports pitches and are on grass so suitable for spikes. All other
distances have short stretches in woods which have a number of exposed
tree roots and a mixture of earth and gravel base. The large field is
mainly rough grassland. The courses are suitable for spikes but please
take care in the woods, some athletes may prefer to run in trail shoes.
<i>(Please note: this advice has been updated since it was originally published.)</i></p>
<h4>IMPORTANT</h4>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big>Please don't warm up on, or run across any marked football pitches.</big></big></p>
<h2>Club tents</h2>
<p>Please respect the above guidance when setting up club tents. Marshals will be on hand to direct accordingly.</p>
