<h2>Sat Nav destination</h2>
<p>Postcode: SO21 3BD (Note: This postcode covers a large area so follow the directions given below as you approach the airfield.)<br />
OS Grid Reference: SU529439</p>
<h2>Directions from Basingstoke</h2>
<p>Take the M3 southbound. At Junction 8, turn off on the A303 towards Andover
and the South West. Climb the hill on the dual carriageway and as you pass
Popham Services (Starbucks &amp; BP on left side, Popham Diner &amp; Esso on
right side) you should be able to see the big orange airfield windsock on the
other side of the dual carriageway. Continue to about 1/2 mile and take the
next exit left signed Micheldever Station &amp; Overton. Drop down to the
bottom, turn right under the A303 bridge, turn immediately right again as if
rejoining the A303 towards Basingstoke. This is a two-way slip road and the
airfield entrance brick and iron gates at the top of the rise on your left just
100 metres before you rejoin the A303.</p>
<h2>Directions from Andover</h2>
<p>Take the A303 eastbound. Note when you cross the junction of the A34
(Bullington Cross) and stay on the A303. Discount one very small road on the
left (to Norton), continue to the second main exit marked with countdown
boards, signed Micheldever Station and Overton. Drop down the slip road, and at
the end go straight on as as if rejoining the A303 towards Basingstoke (this
requires a little wiggle right and left) but the slip road is now signposted
Popham Airfield. You will see the brick and iron gates of the airfield on the
left, just 100 metres before rejoining the A303.</p>
<h2>Directions from Newbury</h2>
<p>Travel south on the A34. Pass Whitchurch. Turn left on the A303 eastbound
towards Basingstoke (Bullington Cross). Follow latter part of Andover direction
as above.</p>
<h2>Directions from Winchester</h2>
<p>Take the A34 northbound. Turn right on the A303 eastbound towards
Basingstoke (Bullington Cross). Follow latter part of Andover direction as
above.</p>
