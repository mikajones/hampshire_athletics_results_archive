<h2>Athlete registration</h2>
<p>All athletes, from the Under 13 age group upwards, taking part in
competitions held under UKA Rules must be registered with England
Athletics. Therefore, it would be helpful and save time if all athletes and team managers could provide EA
registration numbers on their championship entry forms, though this is not essential. We will check
all athletes' registrations, whether or not registration numbers are
given.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Please note:
this rule does not apply to Under 11 athletes who do not need to be
registered with England Athletics. You can leave the box on the form
blank.</span></p>
<p>Advice on registration rules for athletes (and parents of young athletes) is available at <a href="http://www.englandathletics.org/athlete-registration">www.englandathletics.org/athlete-registration</a>.</p>

UKA Anti-Doping Rules and to submit to the authority of UK Anti-Doping
in the application and enforcement of the Anti-Doping Rules.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">"The UKA Anti-Doping Rules apply to
