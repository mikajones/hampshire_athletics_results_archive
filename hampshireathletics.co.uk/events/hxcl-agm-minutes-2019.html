<p>The Chairman opened the meeting at 7.36pm.</p>
<h2>Minutes of Previous Meeting</h2>
<p>These were accepted as a true record of the meeting held on 22 June 2018.</p>
<h2>Matters Arising</h2>
<p>It was agreed at the previous AGM that the new team scoring rule
introduced last season (best 4 from 5, rather than all 5) should be
monitored. Pam Rogers stated that team participation had been improved,
which was the aim of the rule change.</p>
<h2>Chairman's Report</h2>
<p>The season saw an increase in numbers participating.</p>
<p>We thank Bournemouth AC, Aldershot, Farnham &amp; District AC,
Basingstoke &amp; Mid Hants AC assisted by Overton Harriers, Reading AC
and Hardley Runners assisted by Winchester &amp; District AC for
hosting the fixtures.</p>
<p>The position of Chairman is still vacant.</p>
<h2>Secretary's Report</h2>
<p>Once again, it is requested that all clubs supply a new list in
advance of next season's first fixture of their members likely to
compete in each age group, using one of the formats supplied by Pam
Rogers.</p>
<h2>Treasurer's Report</h2>
<p>I would like to thank our host clubs for last season (Aldershot,
Basingstoke, Bournemouth, Reading and Hardley Runners) for hosting.</p>
<p>As detailed in the accounts summary, we have an income surplus this
year of £1685.10, however we did not have any M2 costs as AFD took the
decision to support us by absorbing the costs for the second year
running. This combined with the £1000 sponsorship from Alton Sports are
the factors that have enabled us to build up our financial resources.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank all our host clubs for endeavouring to
keep fixture costs to a minimum whenever they have been able to do so.</p>
<p>The committee would like to recommend that the following clubs pay the lower £50 affiliation fee for the 2019/20 season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Victory</li>
<li>Romsey Road Runners</li>
<li>Ryde Harriers</li>
<li>University of Southampton</li>
<li>Jersey Spartan</li>
</ul>
<p>The 6 clubs with the largest runner participation will continue to pay £150 league affiliation, and are this season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aldershot, Farnham &amp; District</li>
<li>Basingstoke &amp; Mid Hants</li>
<li>Winchester &amp; District</li>
<li>Southampton</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>City of Salisbury</li>
</ul>
<p>with all other clubs as well as any new clubs this season paying the middle band fee of £100.</p>
<p>Finally I would like to thank our sponsors for this season and next Alton Sports and Dave Vosser for auditing the accounts.</p>

<h2>New Membership Affiliation/Resignation</h2>
<p>Interest in joining the League has been expressed by OS Runners.</p>
<h2>Amendments to Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>Proposed by Reading Roadrunners<br />
<b>We propose that this league is in favour of equal race distances for
senior women and men. For each fixture the host club shall decide which
course they prefer to use for the senior races - the distance should be
the same for both senior races - between approximately 6km and
approximately 8km.</b><br />
This was proposed by Mark Worringham and seconded by Richard Davidson.
Mark Worringham briefly stated the case for the proposal and the
Chairman drew the meeting's attention to the rationale supplied by
Reading RR and sent out with the AGM agenda. Several people then spoke
against the proposal, the general opinion being that it would result in
a reduction of the numbers of women or men or both participating.<br />
A vote was then held, with 1 in favour, 11 against and 1 abstention.<br />
<i>Result: proposal defeated.</i></li>
<li>Proposed by Reading Roadrunners<br />
<b>We propose that the Hampshire Cross Country League should equalise
veteran categories so that all veteran categories start at V40.</b><br />
This was proposed by Mark Worringham and seconded by Marilyn Crocker.<br />
A vote was then held, with 8 in favour, 5 against and no abstentions.<br />
<i>Result: proposal adopted.</i></li>
<li>Proposed by the Committee<br />
<b>We propose that the medal/trophy list be extended;<br />
</b><ul>
<li><b>Extend U17 Men's and Women's Teams from 1st to 1,2,3.</b></li>
<li><b>Extend Combined Senior/U20/Veteran Women's Teams from 1st to 1,2,3.</b></li>
<li><b>Extend Veteran Women Teams from 1st to 1,2,3.</b></li>
<li><b>Change the Women's Individual Veteran trophy winners from 1,2,3,4 to 1,2,3 and first O45, to mirror the Men's awards.</b></li>
<li><b>Extend Senior/U20/Veteran Men's Teams in Div I from 1st to 1st, Runner up</b></li>
<li><b>Extend Veteran Men Teams from 1st to 1,2.</b></li>
</ul>
It was noted that, due to the adoption of the previous proposal, the award to the first O45 woman would now be to the first O50.<br />
This was proposed by Pam Rogers and seconded by Liz Flitcroft.<br />
A vote was then held, with 13 in favour, none against and no abstentions.<br />
<i>Result: proposal adopted.</i></li>
</ol>

<h2>Election of Officers</h2>
<p>The Secretary, Treasurer, Men's Results Secretary and Ladies'
Results Secretary were re-elected, en bloc, as proposed by David Vosser
and seconded by Tim Eglen. As no candidates had come forward for the
post, the Secretary agreed to continue as Acting Chairman. However, it
is vital for the health of the League that this vacancy is filled on a
permanent basis.</p>
<h2>Presentation of Senior Awards</h2>
<p>The awards from the last season for Under 20s, Seniors and Veterans
were made, generally to representatives from the recipients' clubs.
However, Mark Worringham was there to receive his award for first
Veteran Man in person.</p>
<h2>Any Other Business</h2>
<p>Pam Rogers asked the meeting whether the Popplewell Trophy for
contribution by an individual to the League is still relevant, as
nominations in the last few years have been scarce. Those at the
meeting agreed that it is still worthwhile. Pam asked all clubs to
consider a nomination, which would normally (but not necessarily) be a
member of their own club. It was noted that members of the League
Committee are not eligible.</p>
<p>The meeting closed at 8.57pm.</p>
