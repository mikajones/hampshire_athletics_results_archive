League 2002/3<BR>
2 November at Goodwood, Chichester (Match 2)</H1>
<P><B>Exhilarating</B> - was the description from one competitor.
<B>Congratulations to everybody</B> - the weather was against us but the
competition and enthusiasm was great. The result envelopes were disintegrating,
biros were blotting and timesheets were soggy but the accuracy of the officials
gave us a complete return of results.</P>
<P><B>Thank you Chichester</B> for all your tremendous efforts - the marquee
was much appreciated and the food wonderful and our thoughts were with you as
we drove away. You gave us a good meeting in conditions that were near
impossible.</P>
<P><B>The Competition</B> The story is Aldershot with six wins out of eight,
other good results include another powerful score for Bournemouth in the Vet
Men's League and Team Solent showing remarkable strength in scoring 111 to lead
Div III in Senior Men's league and register, overall, a second match day score.
The front runners in the individual aggregates for the younger athletes is
taking shape.</P>
