<h2>Minutes of Previous Meeting</h2>
<p>These were accepted as a true record of the meeting held on 12 June 2015.</p>
<h2>Matters Arising</h2>
<p>This year's award of the Popplewell Trophy will be made at the Farley Mount fixture.</p>
<h2>Chairman's Report</h2>
<p>It is good to report that the League was again well supported by 35 Clubs with 3241 finishers but a slight decrease on last season.</p>
<p>I thank Alton Sports for their support which will continue for next season.</p>
<p>Thanks go to our host clubs:- Winchester AC, Basingstoke &amp; Mid Hants AC, Bournemouth AC, Reading AC and Hardley Runners who stepped in at the last moment to give us five fixtures.</p>
<p>A special thanks most go to Mick Anglin for his hard work in organising this meeting. It is with much regret that the day and the future of this venue was spoilt by the totally inconsiderate parking on the local roads with one person's drive blocked all day when clear instructions were given of the car parking arrangements made by Mick.</p>
<p>I thank the committee for their hard work and especially to Alan who is stepping down from producing the Male Results for the last seven seasons but is willing to continue as League Secretary.</p>
<p>Thanks must also go to Richard Dean for all his work on the web site keeping everyone informed on details of venues and the Results.</p>
<h2>Secretary's Report</h2>
<p>The Secretary will relinquish the task of producing the men's results next season but continue as Secretary.</p>
<p>The Secretary thanked the clubs that had submitted lists of probable competitors (as requested last year). Although not all clubs had done so, those that did had eased the task of processing race results.</p>
<p>It is requested that all clubs supply a new list in advance of next season's first fixture of their members likely to compete in each age group, using one of the formats supplied by Pam Rogers.</p>
<h2>Treasurer's Report</h2>
<p>As detailed in the accounts summary we have an income surplus this year of £1075.91, and I must thank our host clubs for last season (Winchester, Basingstoke, Bournemouth, Reading and Hardley Runners (with assistance from other clubs)) for not only hosting but also keeping costs very similar to last year.</p>
<p>One concern I do have is that host clubs provide dedicated First Aid Cover rather than the first aider doubling up with another role on the day. If this proves a little more expensive then to my mind that is the cost we have to pay.</p>
<p>After consideration by the committee it has been decided to raise the cap on the Winchester fixture to £700, bearing in mind that this has been at £650 for a number of years and it costs the club to host for us.</p>
<p>It has also been decided that we keep the three levels of affiliation and the clubs who would pay the £50 affiliation fee for the 2016/17 season would be:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Dorchester</li>
<li>Lordshill Road Runners</li>
</ul>
<p>The 6 clubs with the largest runner participation will continue to pay £150 league affiliation, and are as last season</p>
<ul>
<li>Aldershot, Farnham &amp; District</li>
<li>Reading AC</li>
<li>Winchester &amp; District</li>
<li>Southampton</li>
<li>Basingstoke &amp; Mid Hants</li>
<li>City of Portsmouth</li>
</ul>
<p>with all other clubs as well as any new clubs this season paying the middle band fee of £90.</p>
<p>Finally I would like to thank Dave Vosser for auditing the accounts and our sponsors for this season and next Alton Sports.</p>
<h2>New Membership Affiliation/Resignation</h2>
<p>There was nothing to report at this early stage.</p>
<h2>Amendments to Constitution</h2>
<p>None proposed.</p>

<p>Efforts are in progress by City of Portsmouth AC to organise the final fixture at Queen Elizabeth Country Park.</p>
<h2>Election of Officers</h2>
<p>The Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer and Ladies' Secretary were re-elected, en bloc. Pam Bungay was elected as Men's Results Secretary.</p>
<h2>Presentation of Senior Awards</h2>
<p>The awards from the last season for Under 20s, Seniors and Veterans were made, generally to representatives from the recipients' clubs. However, Matthew Arnold, Lance Nortcliff, Lucy Pygott and Sarah Urwin-Mann were there to receive their awards in person.</p>
<h2>Any Other Business</h2>
<p>There was discussion over the need for two divisions in the Veteran Men, occasioned by Poole AC (Division 2) beating Winchester (Division 1).</p>
<p>In the light of Poole AC's outstanding performance, the committee had decided to award team medals to Poole AC, whereas usually there would be none for Division 2.</p>
<p>The meeting closed at 8.12pm.</p>
