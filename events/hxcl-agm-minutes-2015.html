season's first fixture of their members likely to compete in each age
group.</b></p>

<h2>Chairman's Report</h2>
<p>I am pleased to say that the league has had another successful season.</p>
<p>35 clubs affiliated with a total of 3409 finishers an increase of
84. The highest number since I have kept a record (2008/9 season).</p>
<p>We thank the organising clubs:- Winchester AC, Chichester Runners, Basingstoke &amp; MH, Reading AC and Bournemouth AC.</p>
<p>It is with regret that Chichester Runners have decided not to host a
meeting at Goodwood next season. We thank them for their support and
efforts, especially Phil Baker in organising a meeting each year since
2002.</p>
<p>You will have seen from the agenda that we will have a new sponsor
in Alton Sports next season and we thank Destination Basingstoke for
their support for the last two years.</p>
<p>I also thank the committee for their commitment and hard work in supporting the League.</p>
<p><i>Ken Littlejohns<br />Chairman</i></p>
<h2>Treasurer's Report</h2>
<p>Whilst our income from affiliation fees was down on last season (£3600 to £3350)<br />
- two clubs did not renew and 5 clubs paid new the lower rate of £50</p>
<p>Our running costs were also less (£3167.38 from £3349.54)<br />
Trophies and engraving were less - Thanks to Pam - and the other saving
was with the results envelopes which were bought in February 2014 and
should last for the upcoming season<br />
- whilst match costs and first aid were £141-40 higher, my thanks to
all clubs for their efforts to minimise the leagues expenses and source
cheaper toilets/first aid etc.</p>
<p>Thanks also to Destination Basingstoke who again sponsored us last season.</p>
<p>This gives us an income surplus of £734.41 which, with the slightly
reduced number of clubs and changes to the affiliation fees, compares
well with the previous seasons £802.25 (before the exceptional payments
to Chichester and Basingstoke reduced the final surplus to £120.50).</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that we keep the three levels of affiliation
and the clubs who would pay the £50 affiliation fee for the 2015/16
season would be:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Wessex Road Runners</li>
<li>Isle of Wight Road Runners</li>
<li>Lordshill Road Runners</li>
</ul>
<p>The 6 clubs with the largest runner participation will continue to pay £150 league affiliation, and are as last season</p>
<ul>
<li>Aldershot, Farnham &amp; District</li>
<li>Reading AC</li>
<li>Winchester &amp; District</li>
<li>Southampton</li>
<li>Basingstoke &amp; Mid Hants</li>
<li>City of Portsmouth</li>
</ul>
