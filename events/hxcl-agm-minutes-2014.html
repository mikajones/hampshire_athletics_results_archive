<h2>Election of Officers</h2>

<h2>Presentation of Senior Awards</h2>

<h2>Any Other Business</h2>
<ul>
<li>The committee asked that clubs supply a list in advance of the first fixture of their members likely to compete in each age group. It is hoped that this will ease the task of the results secretaries and improve the accuracy of the results. It would also be appreciated if the list could be updated with new members between fixtures.</li>
<li>The Ladies' Results Secretary emphasised that competition in the League is open only to members of clubs affiliated to the League and this should not be confused with organisations affiliated to Hampshire Athletics, as the League is independent of that association.</li>
<li>Ian Byett highlighted the fact that in some fixtures the winning Senior Men's team was made up largely of second claim athletes. Although this is within the rules, he asked the League to consider whether it is desirable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The meeting closed at 9.00pm.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>
<h4>Proposal from Southampton AC:<br />
To include the U11 age group as part of the formal race programme and competition within the Hampshire Cross Country League.</h4>
<p>My name is Kaye Adamson and I was the U11 cross country Team Manager for Southampton AC last season.</p>
<p>Southampton AC along with other Hampshire Athletics affiliated clubs such as Winchester, New Forest Juniors, City of Portsmouth, Basingstoke &amp; Mid Hants, Chichester, Guernsey, Jersey, Andover, Reading, Wimborne, Aldershot, Camberley, IOW and others have thriving U11 sections within their clubs. As you are aware the U11 age group was very successfully trialled at the Hampshire Cross-Country Championships last year and the age group formally adopted as part of the championships this year with 109 U11 boys and girls competing. Similarly U11 races have been run at the discretion of organisers at Goodwood &amp; King's Park in the last 2 years, for those in school years 5 + 6 and these have also been a huge success. They were very well managed by the host clubs and there were no parking issues as previously feared. At Southampton we have around 50 U11 girls and boys who enjoy running the longer distance, but at present the only Hampshire facility is the 600m element within quadkids in the summer.</p>
<p>Athletics clubs are flourishing in the post Olympic boom of interest in athletics and numbers of young athletes competing are at an all-time high. Most athletics clubs, like Southampton, begin membership at the age of 8 or 9 - School year 4 - and whilst we don't focus too much on performance at this age, learning to take part in competitions is an important part of development. The starting point to run at U13 is 11 years of age which for children with summer birthdays (like my daughter who won the U11 Hampshire Championship) means they can't run cross country at U13 until they reach school year 7, putting them at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Adopting the U11 age group would mean the starting point to run at U11 is 9 years of age, which means all children in school years 5 &amp; 6 and the older ones in year 4 would be able to compete.</p>
<p>I am asking that the League introduce an U11 age group into the cross country league for the coming season to provide competitive opportunity to the thriving U11 sections in many of its affiliated clubs and to help introduce cross country running to a new generation of young athletes.</p>
